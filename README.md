# Web serial API
i used Spech-to-text webpage from task 1 , the diffrence is that i asked the use to connect the arm through Web serial API, after that, any text got from the Speach-to-text will be sent through the serial port to the arm.

# Arduino code
in the arduino file i just wrote tha code based what i searched online, because i don't have the arm and arduino uno, i can't test if the code worked properly or not.

# Simulation
i used [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) simulator and used servo motor as a demo, the simulation is only for showing the logic for moving something in Arduino IDE, you can see the simulation [here](https://wokwi.com/projects/339065590864937554)

# Note
this code i wrote based on assumption that it will work with the servo motor, I am not sure it will work because i didn't test it with any motor or arm.
